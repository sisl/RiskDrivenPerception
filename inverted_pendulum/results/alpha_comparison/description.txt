In this set of experiments we were looking at how the choice of alpha effected for performance for a variety of noise models
Each experiment was run for two different lambdas, about 9 alphas and repeated 5 times
We recorded the returns, average actions, average angles, etc
The results showed that for the nominal model, increased alpha lead to increased safety, up to a point
